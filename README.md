Text Editor
===
  In order to create this text editor I followed along with the tutorial published to https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html. This text editor is less than 1K lines of code and does not depend on any library. In order to better familiarize myself with linux and the command line I developed this project within Ohio State University's virutal linux enviroment. 

In order to run this program run the command make kilo. Then ./kilo which will open a blank text file like so:
![kilo1](Kilo1.png)
